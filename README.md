Hello ! 👋🏻
The website hosted on Glitch was created with the help of 4 persons in the scope of my master degree at emlyon business school. 
More precisely, the 2 weeks challenge regarding this project was to develop an idea to improve the overall hitchhiking experience and present our idea through a website.

Beyond the creation of this "mere" website. This project was all about developping a concept that could serve the initaitive tech for good.
